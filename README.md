# Configuration

See the included `config.ini` file for an example of the configuration format.
The config file must be called `config.ini` and must be located in the current working directory.

# Extensions

The following extensions were implemented for this assignment

1. Pause/resume of the simulation by pressing the spacebar.
2. Showing planet/body names in the simulation.
3. Hiding planet/body names by editing the `config.ini` and setting `label=true` or `label=false`.
4. Use of an extra creational design pattern (prototype and builder are both used).
